I decided to re-do this website because I was getting a constant error with the previous version and it meant that what I posted wasn't actually being published. Also the images were annoying me somewhat, being too large, too small etc. I prefer the cleaner look of this new Hugo theme. It feels like it gives me, and the reader, more space to think.

I think 'finding space' is a key attribute in life. It is particularly visible in football, where the great players are the ones who find space. Everyone tends to charge headlong towards 'the thing', but if you don't do that, and just hang back a little, have a bit of composure, you maybe see spaces which need filling, be they evolutionary niches, or goalscoring opportunities.

Anyway I hope the new design gives you a new perspective on what I've written.
