Just to draw your attention to the fact that one of my articles, [Time And The Infinite Game](https://liminal.ghost.io/time-and-the-infinite-game-3/) is featured in the new literary journal, [Liminal](https://liminal.ghost.io/).

This online publication comes out of the Creative Word writing course taught by Daniel Pinchbeck (and which I believe has improved my writing style). The standard is very high so I feel privileged to be included. Check out some of the other articles and please do sign up for the digest if you enjoy them.
