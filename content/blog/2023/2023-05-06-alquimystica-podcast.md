Not enough content and information in your life? Ok yes I know you are drowning in it, as are we all. But if you are interested in the very specific topic of psychedelic integration and how to bring the insights of your entheogenic adventures into your daily life, then I think you will be interested in [this particular episode](https://alquimystica.substack.com/p/ep-2-psychedelic-integration-interview), featuring an interview between my friend Emer and Marc Aixal√†, the author of Psychotherapy for Non-Ordinary States of Consciousness and a founder member of [ICEERS](https://www.iceers.org/about-us/) (The International Center for Ethnobotanical Education, Research, and Service).

I also know Marc from [my various experiences of Holotropic Breathwork](https://guyjames.com/2014/08/24/eczema-as-koan-part-3-the-way-out/) because he has often been a facilitator when I have been doing the therapy here in Spain. For this reason I know he is a supremely practical and compassionate person with great insights, and very much worth listening to.

The Alquimystica Podcast is a collaboration between Emer and myself; she does the interviews and I edit and produce them. I hope you will [subscribe on Substack](https://alquimystica.substack.com/) and check out the other episodes as they come out. The first episode was [an interview with Natalie Zeituny](https://alquimystica.substack.com/p/alquimystica-ep-01-creating-reality), the originator of the Ensoulment Process.
