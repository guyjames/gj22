      <description>“There is no urgency. Summer does not rush towards autumn. One tiny blade of grass is not trying to grow faster than its neighbour. The planets spin lazily in their orbits. This ancient universe is in no hurry.&#xA;But the mind, feeling so divided from the totality, wants answers now, wants solutions today, wants to know so badly. It wants to reach its precious conclusions. And, ultimately, it wants to be in control.</description>

      <description>The goal of meditation – if there is a goal – is to make thoughts, emotions, and apparent limitations transparent so that the absolute reality, the changeless and limitless, can be perceived through them.&#xA;El objetivo de la meditación – si hay un objetivo – es hacer transparente los pensamientos, emociones y limitaciones aparentes, para que se pueda percibir la realidad absoluta, lo inmutable y sin límites, a través de ellos.</description>

      <description>“O gifted men, vainglorious for first place,&#xA;how short a time the laurel crown stays green&#xA;……………………………………..&#xA;A breath of wind is all there is to fame&#xA;here upon earth: it blows this way and that,&#xA;and when it changes quarter it changes name.”&#xA;– Dante.&#xA;It’s a shame that the winner in Formula 1 no longer gets a laurel wreath like they used to. Perhaps because we have forgotten that success is inherently transient.</description>

      <description>The only time I’ve really felt proud to be British in recent times was watching the recent Bill Hicks documentary. In the USA Bill was playing tiny clubs and people just didn’t ‘get’ him. He came to the UK and was soon selling out the 4,000 seater Dominion Theatre in London. His relief at finally being understood makes me proud of our ‘black’ sense of humour.</description>

      <description>The psyche has an almost relentless tendency to create and draw toward itself experiences that match the experiential quality of the unconscious inner material. Thus, a person with leftover trauma from choking in the birth canal will unconsciously create situations of high stress, with no room to breathe or the world closing in. These patterns can persist indefinitely until the material is faced on the level from which it originates as powerful leftover emotions from within the psyche.</description>

      <description>Dream: i heard a noise coming out of the bean bag. i undid the zip- i sensed that this was the place all my songs came from. out came a big black spider, which started spinning a web. the spider changed into a panther with strong piercing eyes. i was repulsed by the spider, but was less afraid of the panther. i put my hand out, and it jumped at it, but more playfully than anything.</description>
