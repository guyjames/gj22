      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I would add a brief update related to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2014/08/12/eczema-as-koan-part-1/&#34; &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;&gt;previous posts&lt;/a&gt; about becoming healed from severe eczema. These passages are adapted from replies to people on the Eczema/Topical Steroid Withdrawal group on Facebook. Given the ephemeral nature of Facebook I wanted to save them somewhere in case they might be useful to anyone in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This is part three of my account of how I came to experience full healing from a very severe experience of eczema lasting several years. Part one is here and part two is here.&#xA;3I have covered my journey of healing and discovery up until this point, which took the form of a voyage into the depths of Hell and out again.&#xA;Looking back now, I can see that – after all the very difficult experiences of reliving my own birth, and releasing so much anger and resentment (I have barely scratched the surface here), plus experiencing mythic situations both hellish and heavenly – the real breakthrough came during the sixth session of Holotropic Breathwork I experienced in Barcelona.</description>

      <description>This is part two of my account of how I came to experience full healing from a very severe experience of eczema lasting several years. Part one is here and part three is here&#xA;Having ‘turned the corner’ as it were, (in terms of hope for the future if not in an actual improvement in my health), although I didn’t know for sure then if it was a genuine ‘touching rock bottom’, or merely one more step on the way down, I began to search for something which might genuinely make a difference to my health.</description>

      <description>This is part one of a three part article; part two is here and the final part is here&#xA;An excerpt from a recent article on my blog:&#xA;“About four years ago I spilt up with my girlfriend and subsequently became rather ill – I was eventually hospitalised and on admission the first nurse who saw me in a hospital gown assumed I had been burnt in a house fire, so badly destroyed was the weeping, bleeding skin all over my body.</description>
