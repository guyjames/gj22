      <description>There is a zen saying: &amp;ldquo;ordinary mind is Buddha mind&amp;rdquo;. I did understand this saying, but yesterday I realised it in a whole new way: Often what prompts us to start investigating &amp;rsquo;this spiritual stuff&amp;rsquo;, is a feeling of isolation; we feel as if, as this quote from A.E. Housman illustrates —&#xA;&amp;lsquo;I, a stranger and afraid, in a world I never made.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;We feel cut off from the source of life in some undefinable way, atomised by societal conditioning and our own past.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.&amp;rdquo; ― C. G. Jung&#xA;Some practitioners of meditation appear to be holding on to assumptions which, while possibly beneficial in the proper context, can in fact end up being actually harmful when misunderstood. I speak from personal experience here, and also often see others struggling with this. You may well recognise it from your own practice.</description>
