      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just saw this film yesterday and it totally blew me away. Someone had said I should see it but I couldn’t remember why, I watched the whole thing with this nagging feeling at the back of my mind that there was something very odd about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After it was over I looked it up on the net and then I remembered: the reason I particularly wanted to see it (apart from the fact that I want to see all of Herzog’s films), and  &lt;span class=&#34;pullquote&#34;&gt;one of the reasons it is very odd, is that all the actors in it are hypnotised, except one&lt;/span&gt;, Josef Bierbichler, who plays Hias, the herdsman who can see into the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
