      <description>By which I mean, just ‘being’ without doing anything, thinking anything in particular, or trying to be anyone special.&#xA;In this way we are not ‘productive’, we are not caught in the trap of ‘becoming’, we are not placing hope in an illusory ‘future’ which acts as a drug to stop us seeing the reality of how things are right now.&#xA;We are defying the corporate mindset that all people have to be efficient cogs in the machine, the machine which will deliver us to our inevitable technological Utopia.</description>
