      <description>“The inability to conceive of its own devastation will tend to be the blind spot of any culture.&amp;quot; — Jonathan Lear in Radical Hope: Ethics in the Face of Cultural Devastation.&#xA;&amp;ldquo;What is soul?

      <description>Not enough content and information in your life? Ok yes I know you are drowning in it, as are we all. But if you are interested in the very specific topic of psychedelic integration and how to bring the insights of your entheogenic adventures into your daily life, then I think you will be interested in this particular episode, featuring an interview between my friend Emer and Marc Aixalà, the author of Psychotherapy for Non-Ordinary States of Consciousness and a founder member of ICEERS (The International Center for Ethnobotanical Education, Research, and Service).</description>

      <description>Just to draw your attention to the fact that one of my articles, Time And The Infinite Game is featured in the new literary journal, Liminal.&#xA;This online publication comes out of the Creative Word writing course taught by Daniel Pinchbeck (and which I believe has improved my writing style). The standard is very high so I feel privileged to be included. Check out some of the other articles and please do sign up for the digest if you enjoy them.</description>

      <description>I decided to re-do this website because I was getting a constant error with the previous version and it meant that what I posted wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually being published. Also the images were annoying me somewhat, being too large, too small etc. I prefer the cleaner look of this new Hugo theme. It feels like it gives me, and the reader, more space to think.&#xA;I think &amp;lsquo;finding space&amp;rsquo; is a key attribute in life.</description>

      <description>My newsletter is well under way now, with a series on Dark Forces, coordination failures, myth, metaphor, DAOs, psychedelics, philosophy etc. now reaching part five: Do Look Up - John Lilly and the Solid State Intelligence.&#xA;In the series I go into the possible reasons why &amp;lsquo;we can&amp;rsquo;t have nice things&amp;rsquo;: Are autonomous &amp;lsquo;dark forces&amp;rsquo; conspiring to enslave us to their techno-agenda? Is it simply a series of coordination failures or a tragedy of the commons?</description>

      <description>I am pleased to say that I am now the owner of the ENS domain name, guyjames.eth. ENS domains are domain names which are registered on the Ethereum blockchain.&#xA;I had been hesitant to register one because of the horrendous gas fees but I regretted not doing so sooner, as there recently was an airdrop to everyone who had one of these domains in ENS governance tokens, and which ended up being potentially quite lucrative.</description>

      <description>There is a zen saying: &amp;ldquo;ordinary mind is Buddha mind&amp;rdquo;. I did understand this saying, but yesterday I realised it in a whole new way: Often what prompts us to start investigating &amp;rsquo;this spiritual stuff&amp;rsquo;, is a feeling of isolation; we feel as if, as this quote from A.E. Housman illustrates —&#xA;&amp;lsquo;I, a stranger and afraid, in a world I never made.&amp;rsquo;&#xA;We feel cut off from the source of life in some undefinable way, atomised by societal conditioning and our own past.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.&amp;rdquo; ― C. G. Jung&#xA;Some practitioners of meditation appear to be holding on to assumptions which, while possibly beneficial in the proper context, can in fact end up being actually harmful when misunderstood. I speak from personal experience here, and also often see others struggling with this. You may well recognise it from your own practice.</description>

      <title>Is Your Life Really Predetermined?</title>

      <description>I was watching, and enjoying, the series Devs, developed by Alex Garland - if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it, it&amp;rsquo;s a philosophical conundrum wrapped in a streaming mini-series format, something like Black Mirror or Mr Robot, with a very nice aesthetic to the music and design. Or it&amp;rsquo;s a standard sci-fi mini-series with pretensions to having something to say philosophically. Anyway it got me thinking, which presumably is the point.&#xA;Back in the day I was somewhat into teachers like Ramesh Balsekar, Roger Castillo, Tony Parsons and Lisa Cairns, who all basically go with the idea of a totally predetermined universe - Wikipedia explains: Ramesh Balsekar - Wikipedia</description>

Unos proyectos muy interesantes, organizado por pandorahub.co y La Palma Renovable, dos proyectos super-potentes.&#xA;Hablo de la situación actual con la economia yendo de crisis a crisis, porque el capitalismo es eficiente pero no resiliente, porque la demanda es más importante que la oferta cuando se hace el diseño de una moneda alternativa, el crédito mútuo, criptomonedas, Holochain, etc.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;We broke the ruptured structure built of age.&amp;rdquo; - David Bowie, Cygnet Committee.&#xA;I was just listening to the eMERGE podcast, the interview with Jamie Wheal by Daniel Thorson, and they were talking about the perception that, bit by bit, everything familiar is being deconstructed. And I remember that I had the sensation the other day when I woke up, that money had no value; that I would live to see a day, or there will be a day when, suddenly or gradually, money has no value - that we would have completely lost faith in the concept of money itself.</description>

      <description>After an abortive attempt to relaunch last year, I finally locked myself into an apartment and didn&amp;rsquo;t let myself out until I had it more or less done this time. There are still a few things to do (more technical details for those interested, below), such as paginate the stream of posts - at the moment it&amp;rsquo;s just one long list, and crucially, add comments - my technical demands mean I can&amp;rsquo;t just go for the easy option, so those will have to wait.</description>

      <description>The kid was waiting for a train. Alfie paused as the previous one roared without stopping through the station. Deathly silence for a second, then a thought, a naked flash.&#xA;He had heard that the Emperor had asked for a new suit of clothes. The fabricators had told him they would use the latest technology. It was all over the networks. They would use a quantum-potential fabric which would appear thicker depending on the intelligence of the perceiver.</description>

All contemporary political movements are in some way progressive, and in this article I will argue where that comes from, and why buying into the idea of Progress, as currently understood, will only serve to deepen our current predicament.</description>

      <description>We all know that ‘love’ is a dirty word these days. It is relentlessly abused by advertisers who always seek to exploit our earliest psychological bonds with our parents and then by sheer repetition, associate themselves with those symbols we learnt in our childhood relating to those bonds. ‘Love’ is one such, and massively overused by Hollywood to boot, in its romantic aspect.&#xA;However, as Cornel West so eloquently put it —</description>

      <description>“There is no urgency. Summer does not rush towards autumn. One tiny blade of grass is not trying to grow faster than its neighbour. The planets spin lazily in their orbits. This ancient universe is in no hurry.&#xA;But the mind, feeling so divided from the totality, wants answers now, wants solutions today, wants to know so badly. It wants to reach its precious conclusions. And, ultimately, it wants to be in control.</description>

      <description>The goal of meditation – if there is a goal – is to make thoughts, emotions, and apparent limitations transparent so that the absolute reality, the changeless and limitless, can be perceived through them.&#xA;El objetivo de la meditación – si hay un objetivo – es hacer transparente los pensamientos, emociones y limitaciones aparentes, para que se pueda percibir la realidad absoluta, lo inmutable y sin límites, a través de ellos.</description>

      <title>The Emptiness of ‘Emptiness’:  P2P Spiritual Knowledge and Community</title>

      <description>Michel Bauwens points out in his article ‘If we can have p2p economics, why not p2p spirituality?’ that the dominant spiritual and economic models of a particular age often mirror each other:&#xA;“Spirituality and religion always bear the hallmark of the social structures in which they were born and become embedded. Emerging religions often represent a partial transformation of these social structures because they represent new forms of consciousness, but they can never become hegemonic if they are not rooted in, and accepted by, the mainstream social logic.</description>

      <description>This is part three of my account of how I came to experience full healing from a very severe experience of eczema lasting several years. Part one is here and part two is here.&#xA;3I have covered my journey of healing and discovery up until this point, which took the form of a voyage into the depths of Hell and out again.&#xA;Looking back now, I can see that – after all the very difficult experiences of reliving my own birth, and releasing so much anger and resentment (I have barely scratched the surface here), plus experiencing mythic situations both hellish and heavenly – the real breakthrough came during the sixth session of Holotropic Breathwork I experienced in Barcelona.</description>

Part one is here and part three is here&#xA;Having ‘turned the corner’ as it were, (in terms of hope for the future if not in an actual improvement in my health), although I didn’t know for sure then if it was a genuine ‘touching rock bottom’, or merely one more step on the way down, I began to search for something which might genuinely make a difference to my health.</description>

      <description>The recent article by Josh Ellis ‘Everyone I Know Is Brokenhearted which has apparently gone viral, seems to have struck a chord among large numbers of people seriously disaffected by the current state of affairs in which we find ourselves. I also read a moving companion piece in A counterpoint for the brokenhearted in which the author provides pays tribute to a friend who did everything he could to relieve the suffering of desperate people.</description>

There is then a state of enlightened anarchy. In such a state everyone is his own ruler. He rules himself in such a manner that he is never a hindrance to his neighbour. In the ideal State, therefore, there is no political power because there is no State.’&lt;/strong&gt; – Gandhi&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;‘&lt;strong&gt;Anarchy is not misrule but no rule’&lt;/strong&gt; – Floating Anarchy Manifesto, Daevid Allen&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following on from my previous post, ‘&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2013/08/03/big-brother-is-the-reincarnation-of-god/&#34; &#xA;  &#xA;  &#xA;&gt;Big Brother is the Reincarnation of God&lt;/a&gt;, I have been considering how we give up our power to our god-surrogate, whether that be in the form of governments, corporations, or indeed organised religions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course one of the main ways in which we surrender ourselves to the ‘Man Upstairs’ is through opting for convenience over our own long term benefit. I remember when Google first launched the GMail service, and certain troublemakers pointed out that the Big G would have to analyse all our private emails in order to supply us with targeted advertising. I considered these warnings for a few minutes, to be sure, but then remembering the Google motto of ‘Don’t Be Evil’, and their perceived track record of generally being pretty good around privacy issues, I chose, as apparently a vast majority did, to ignore the potential dangers and focus on the features of this new email service. And I have to say, that GMail &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a great email service, and certainly pushed the whole notion of how to provide email up a level, introducing many innovations which have since been copied by other providers (even Microsoft eventually caught on, after a few years).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But with the Snowden revelations, and those of other whistleblowers, we realise that our trust in Google was misplaced, or perhaps being more charitable, our trust in how the internet works was misplaced – we still don’t know how much Google or other corporations knew about, or are able to prevent, the likes of the NSA spying on everyone’s emails. We may assume that as they didn’t see it as a problem to analyse everyone’s emails themselves, that personal privacy was not exactly at the top of their list, but of course we had the clear option of rejecting the GMail model on privacy grounds, and we chose not to, which brings me to one of the main points of this article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Big thanks to Scutty Lefunk who helped out with large parts of it and contributed two of the greatest guitar solos you will hear, on ‘Crashing on the rocks in your head’ and ‘Residue’.</description>

      <description>Having read Douglas Rushkoff’s excellent appraisal of the Occupy Wall Street movement, I felt I would like to add some thoughts.&#xA;There is a new consciousness crystallising, and Rushkoff said something which (as usual) was very insightful, in that the mainstream media are having trouble getting to grips with the (r)evolution because they can’t see it, it just looks like a jumble of different causes all mixed together, and the people at the heart of it refuse to discuss it on the mainstream media’s terms, and reduce everything to black and white and soundbites.</description>

      <description>Buddhists call what they do when they sit down to meditate ‘practice’. Of course all words are imperfect when we enter the tricky realm of the non-dual but I really feel this term is misleading if we are wanting to enter the Absolute in our meditation. The idea of meditation being something one practices and gradually becomes good at creates the feeling that in the future, when we are ‘good at meditation’ we will enter the Eternal Present.</description>

      <description>By which I mean, just ‘being’ without doing anything, thinking anything in particular, or trying to be anyone special.&#xA;In this way we are not ‘productive’, we are not caught in the trap of ‘becoming’, we are not placing hope in an illusory ‘future’ which acts as a drug to stop us seeing the reality of how things are right now.&#xA;We are defying the corporate mindset that all people have to be efficient cogs in the machine, the machine which will deliver us to our inevitable technological Utopia.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does location play a part in your sound?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I am fascinated by the resonance certain places can have, which invests them with almost heroic proportions. The very name of a place itself can inspire awe and credibility. There are countless examples of this in American folk and pop music and beyond and I am trying to key into a mode which elevates places around Britain, which have a personal resonance, into the realm of myth and mystery. In this sense certain locations play a big part in the music we make; trying to mythologise a place which provided the backdrop to some great personal realisation or other.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/interviews/trembling-bells-alex-neilson-i-d-probably-be-a-professional-footballer-if-it-wasn-t-for-trout-mask-replica&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alex Neilson, Trembling Bells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

      <description>I just realised what &amp;lsquo;The News&amp;rsquo; is; it is not primarily a record of the day’s most important events but is actually a presentation of a point of view about a single subject. That subject is Death and the opinion you are invited to have is that it is a Bad Thing. Look at the grim faces of the newsreaders as they describe how many have perished and in what way.</description>

      <description>The only time I’ve really felt proud to be British in recent times was watching the recent Bill Hicks documentary. In the USA Bill was playing tiny clubs and people just didn’t ‘get’ him. He came to the UK and was soon selling out the 4,000 seater Dominion Theatre in London. His relief at finally being understood makes me proud of our ‘black’ sense of humour.</description>

      <description>The psyche has an almost relentless tendency to create and draw toward itself experiences that match the experiential quality of the unconscious inner material. Thus, a person with leftover trauma from choking in the birth canal will unconsciously create situations of high stress, with no room to breathe or the world closing in. These patterns can persist indefinitely until the material is faced on the level from which it originates as powerful leftover emotions from within the psyche.</description>

      <description>Dream: i heard a noise coming out of the bean bag. i undid the zip- i sensed that this was the place all my songs came from. out came a big black spider, which started spinning a web. the spider changed into a panther with strong piercing eyes. i was repulsed by the spider, but was less afraid of the panther. i put my hand out, and it jumped at it, but more playfully than anything.</description>

      <description>Prog rock. Progressive Rock. Filthy, hated, heretical noise, utterly shunned since Year Zero (1976). But I love it… or a great deal of it anyway.&#xA;Those who lump dazzling avatars of God’s Own Progression like Yes, Genesis (the early version, naturally) and King Crimson in with lumpen regurgitators of egoistic bombast like Emerson Lake and Palmer are merely demonstrating their own cloth-ears. Where ELP sound totally of their time, Yes in particular are still in the fantastic future world they created for themselves.</description>

      <description>I was just thinking about the concept of ‘the One’ in relationships and how it affects our expectations. People fall in love and in the midst of the euphoria of those initial weeks (or months if they’re lucky) of bliss, they often believe they have found ‘the One’ – whether they already believed they were waiting for such a person, or the intensity of the experience leads them to believe in such an ideal relationship.</description>

      <description>Last night I had the realisation, but to be honest it felt like a revelation, (and like all good revelations I can’t now understand why it wasn’t already obvious to me), that a great deal of the conflict in the world is caused by clashes between different groups trying to promote their own version of ‘utopia’. I had vaguely intimated this on being sent an article on John Gray, a distinctly anti-utopian philosopher, by my friend Nils Borg.</description>

      <description>But the atheist, you see — the man who advertises his disbelief in god — is a very pious person. Nobody believes in god like an atheist. ‘There is no god, and I am his prophet.’&#xA;Alan Watts&#xA;I’ve always thought that Richard Dawkins and his followers have an evangelical air about them, confirmed by the ‘Atheist Ad Campaign’.&#xA;I mean if religion is a bad thing, then why drag yourself down to their level?</description>

      <description>I’ve been hearing a lot about the Stock Market bubble bursting, or the financial bubble has burst or whatever, but what it really seems to be is that the whole bubble of our culture is about to burst.&#xA;And why? For the same reason that these big financial institutions are in trouble: when something gets totally cut off from reality, it forms a bubble, and forms a little reality of its own- the trouble is, this reality, like any bubble, will pop sooner or later.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just saw this film yesterday and it totally blew me away. Someone had said I should see it but I couldn’t remember why, I watched the whole thing with this nagging feeling at the back of my mind that there was something very odd about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After it was over I looked it up on the net and then I remembered: the reason I particularly wanted to see it (apart from the fact that I want to see all of Herzog’s films), and  &lt;span class=&#34;pullquote&#34;&gt;one of the reasons it is very odd, is that all the actors in it are hypnotised, except one&lt;/span&gt;, Josef Bierbichler, who plays Hias, the herdsman who can see into the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve just realised something that may have been obvious to everyone else for ages: that now the vice-like grip of major label record labels has been loosened, the music business has more or less reached the end of trends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
